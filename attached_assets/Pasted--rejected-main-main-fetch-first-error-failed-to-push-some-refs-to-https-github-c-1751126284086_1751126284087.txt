hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before

hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
